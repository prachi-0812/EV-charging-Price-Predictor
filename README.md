# EV-charging-Price-Predictor
Estimates the price to be paid for charging our EVs
We used different ML models to predict the total price for charging.
We used two different souces of power - solar energy and grid power.
For calculating solar energy available,  we calculated the solar radiations available during any given time and at any given waether conditions.
